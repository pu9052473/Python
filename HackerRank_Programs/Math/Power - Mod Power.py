# Task:
# You are given three integers: a,b, and m. Print two lines.
# On the first line, print the result of pow(a,b). On the second line, print the result of pow(a,b,m).
#
# Input Format:
# The first line contains a, the second line contains b, and the third line contains m.

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
m = int(input())
print(pow(a, b))
print(pow(a, b, m))
