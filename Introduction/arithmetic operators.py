# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
#
# 1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# 2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# 3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
# Example
# a = 3
# b = 5
# Print the following:
# 8
# -2
# 15

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

add = a + b
print(add)
sub = a - b
print(sub)
mul = a * b
print(mul)
